## Current Reminders and Affirmations
    If you have a clearly defined goal, it's ok to make slow progress, or to not feel like you're making progress. Just be consistent. 
    And make damn sure to keep re-evaluating / redefining that goal. 


    Don't make solutions for problems that don't exist. 


    You're smart as fuck. Give it time.
