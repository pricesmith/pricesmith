## Current Reminders and Affirmations
    If you have a clearly defined goal, it's ok to make slow progress, or to not feel like you're making progress. 
    Just be consistent. And make damn sure to keep re-evaluating / redefining that goal. 

    (This is for all the techie stalkers reading this--) Don't make solutions for problems that don't exist. 

    You're smart as fuck. Give it time.
