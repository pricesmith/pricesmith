My name is Price. I'm pretty passionate about enabling people with tools. Tools that actually offer some sort of utility or knowledge to its users. Code is a great way to achieve that. This interest has brought me through a broad expanse of concepts, technologies, and ideas, many or which are fascinating, many of which I have stronger hesitations.
